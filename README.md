# PokeSync - Game Service

## Building and Running the Application

First, make `start.sh` an executable:

```
chmod u+x start.sh
```

And now you can freely run it at the root directory of the project:

```
./start.sh
```

Alternatively, you can also just stick to calling `sh start.sh` but this may require `sudo`.

## Running Tests

```
go test -v ../...
```
